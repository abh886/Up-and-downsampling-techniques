# Up-and-downsampling-techniques
These techniques provide the fundamentals of compression. 
Up sampling refers to adding zero to every alternating non zero value to make sure no distortions are visible.
Down Sampling refers to removing samples in order to avoid corruption of signal. In this code, I have taken
Up sampling to be by a factor of 2, and same for downsampling.
